# Background
The motivation behind this project stems from my personal desire to understand SQL and gain a deeper insight into the data analyst job market. I aimed to discover which skills are the highest paid and most in-demand, thereby making my research more effective and valuable.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. Where are the top_paying data analyst and related jobs considering working from home? 
2. What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts and Data Scientist?
3. What are the top skills based on salary?
4. What are the most optimal skills to learn in high demand and a high-paying skill?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I managed to use several key tools to perform my analysis and manage the project:
- **SQL :** This was the backbone of my entire analysis. I used it to write complex queries, perform aggregations, and filter data to extract the specific insights needed to answer my key questions about job salaries, in-demand skills, and optimal career paths.
- **Postgres SQL :** PostgreSQL: This served as my chosen database management system. All of the job posting data was stored and managed within a PostgreSQL database, where I executed all my SQL queries.
- **Visual Studio Code  :** I used VS Code to write and run my SQL scripts. It was also crucial for organizing my project files and preparing the documentation.
- **Git & GitHub:** These were essential for version control. I used Git to track all changes to my SQL scripts and README.md, and GitHub served as a public repository to share my work and ensure it was accessible to others.
