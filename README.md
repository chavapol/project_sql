# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I managed to use several key tools to perform my analysis and manage the project:

- **SQL :** The backbone of the analysis, used for all data querying and manipulation.

- **PostgreSQL :** The database management system used to store and manage the job data.

- **Visual Studio Code :** My primary environment for writing SQL and managing project files.

- **Git & GitHub :** Essential for version control and collaborating on the project.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field.
```sql 
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
