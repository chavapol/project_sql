### 1. Top Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying remote roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average salary (yearly) via LinkedIn, focusing on remote jobs and available.


```sql
-- Question: What are the top_paying data analyst jobs on LinkedIn?

SELECT	
    company_dim.name AS Company_Name,
    job_title_short AS Title,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    job_work_from_home AS Remote, 
    ROUND(salary_year_avg, 0) AS Salary_yearly
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_work_from_home = true and 
    job_via = 'via LinkedIn' and
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC,
    job_id
